    DNP the most potent fat loss agent available. You can lose 1lb of fat every 1-3 days depending upon your dose and diet. It achieves this effect by raising your metabolism. More specifically, it inhibits the proper production of ATP, causing energy to be wasted as heat. The side effects can be deadly if the drug is not dosed and managed correctly. In short, DNP raises your TDEE.
 
    NOTE: DO NOT TRUST THE SCALE WHILE ON DNP. USE YOUR EYES.
 
    Precautions
 
    DNP can kill you if taken in high, sustained dosages. DNP is not a reversible drug and it is highly advised that you stay within the recommended dosages. If you are currently suffering from any medical issues, it is not recommended that you take DNP.
 
    If you live in a warm environment, it is recommended that you do not take a dose of more than 400mg and instead take a lower dose for a longer period of time.
 
    If you wanna suicide (which is a very stupid idea since DNP death is very painful): Take 5g and a few shots of vodka.
 
    It is not recommended to take DNP on an empty stomach.
 
    While on DNP, it is not recommended to drink alcohol. If you do, balance out your water consumption with alcohol consumption at a 1:1 or higher ratio. Alcohol will dehydrate you which can be deadly when combined with DNP.
 
    If you are taking any other medications, do your research and ensure there are no possible direct or indirect drug interactions which could be harmful.
 
    It is paramount that you do not let your body overheat while on DNP. Heat is the most dangerous effect of DNP.
 
    There isn't really an age restriction (18 year old in general reported being fine after cycle)
 
    NOTE: DNP STRENGTH MAY DIFFER BY SELLER BUT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN SENSITIVITY TO DNP, SO WHAT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU, MIGHT NOT WORK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
     
    Dosing
 
    Common dosages for DNP range from 250mg/day to 750mg/day. The amount of DNP builds up in your blood over time since it has a 36 hour half-life, so you can have upwards of 1500mg of DNP in your blood just from a sustained dose of 500mg/day.
 
    The recommended beginner's cycle is 250mg/day for three weeks. Use this cycle as a probe for your sensitivity to DNP. After this cycle you should refer to the charts below for sample cycles.
 
    If you plan on doing a low-dose cycle for a few or even several months, increase the dosage by 75mg every month to counteract tolerance. The only negative side of a long, low-dose cycle is a slightly higher risk of PN.
 
    Let it be known that there really doesn't have to be a set structure for your cycles. For example, if you wanna take high doses on work days and low doses on off days, that's perfectly fine, just remember that once you take a high dose, keep your cycle under 4 weeks.
 
    DNP comes both as a crystal and as a powder. 250mg crystal = 187.5mg powder.
 
    If you plan on taking a custom dosage of DNP, please refer to these charts:

    Warning: Taking more than the recommended dose of DNP can kill you. Do not take more than 1 gram per day.
 
    Side Effects
 
    Although there are few recent studies of DNP, a fairly extensive list of reported side effects exists. Side effects of DNP can be life threatening and should be managed carefully.
 
     Common Side Effects
        -Heat. The primary and most dangerous side effect of DNP is heat. Do not allow your body temperature to get too high while on DNP.
        -Dehydration. It is recommended to drink at least a gallon of water per day. DNP blunts thirst so you may be dehydrated but not feel thirsty.
        -Temporary water retention and glycogen depletion. This will make you look bloated with flat muscles. Within one week of cessation, this should be gone.
        -Lethargy. DNP will make you feel tired and sluggish.
 
     Less Common Side Effects
        -Diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. These can be exacerbated by high doses or if taken on an empty stomach.
        -Hives/rashes. Please read on for more information on dealing with this side effect.
        -Headaches, insomnia, and sore throat. These are all uncommon but have been reported.
        -Effects of dehydration. Dehydration can go undetected and cause a variety of miscellaneous side effects.
 
     Rare Side Effects
        -Peripheral Neuropathy. Approximately 10% of people will develop this condition. Has a slightly higher risk of occuring if DNP is used longer than 3 weeks.  Immediately cease usage if you begin to feel pins and needles in your hands and feet. Discontinue usage of DNP for 6-8 months thereafter. If you fail to do so, you may permanently lose feeling in your extremities.
        -Cataracts. Rare reports have suggested DNP usage can cause cataracts of the eye. It is thought to only occur in those with a genetic defect that does not allow them to properly deal with a metabolite of DNP, which means that if you don't develop cataracts after a cycle or two, you never have to worry about it again. If you're really concerned about this, just keep in mind that only three men out of the original hundreds of thousands of DNP patients got cataracts.
 
    Helpful Information
 
    Comsuming carbs will increase the intensity of the heat produced by DNP for 1-3 hours afterward.
 
    DNP increases your metabolism. One animal study showed a 64% increase in metabolism. The rate of metabolic increase is dose dependent. Formula: (dose/10)%, after full saturation (Every 100mg of DNP will increase the metabolic efficiency by 11% (crystal) or 15% (powder). This is after a build up of 3-5 days. This number stacks with every 100mg).
 
    (Total metabolic efficiency increase) x (TDEE) = Calories added to TDEE (assuming you're eating at maintenance calories)
 
    Example (.33) x (3,000) = 990 calories added to your TDEE by DNP
 
    So if this person ate at a 1,000 calorie deficit of his TDEE, he would lose ~4 pounds a week, since 1,000 + 990 = 1,990, and every 500 calories cut daily a week is 1 pound.
 
    This math also explains why you lose less weight with DNP as time goes on since your TDEE gets smaller but pls correct me if I'm wrong on this math in the thread
 
    If you begin to overheat, get in an ice bath and call 911. There is not much the paramedics or hospital can do, so avoid overheating in the first place. Because DNP is not a well-known drug, be sure to explain to the paramedics and doctors that the most dangerous side effect of DNP is heat.
 
    If you encounter hives or rashes while using DNP, cease usage and blast Benadryl for three weeks. Cease benadryl usage for two weeks then cruise on an antihistamine for three days. If you plan on starting DNP again, continue anti-histamine usage throughout the cycle and for a week after the last DNP pill. http://i.imgur.com/pHdI0j1.png
 
    It is recommended that you learn healthy eating habits and eat at your drug-free maintenance while on DNP. DNP is useless if you do not learn to eat at maintenance as you will gain all the weight you lose back. It is recommended to run a ketogenic diet, as this can reduce the risk of PN and will give you extra weight loss. If the carb cravings on keto are too much, try running an isocaloric (33%, 33%, 33%) diet. Use the same caloric intake that you used during your cycle for at least one week after you're done so that you give DNP time to exit your body before you go back to cutting/start bulking.
 
    If you are not feeling the side effects of DNP on lower doses, wait five days to allow blood buildup. Do not be impatient or aggressive with DNP dosing.
 
    Working out is fine on low doses. At 400mg+, however, you will want to keep workouts short. You will not grow on DNP and may overheat or exhaust yourself by working out too much. This includes cardio - Cardio is not recommended on higher doses of DNP. Even if you do not overheat, you will deplete water in large amounts and may not know you are dehydrated because DNP blunts thirst.
 
    There is sparse information on the safety of DNP in long term usage (See DNP Guru's posts). Progress from this drug is unparalleled but you must also weigh the risk vs. reward.
 
    Weed is fine on DNP.
 
    Do everyone in the thread a favor and post pictures of your shipments along with the shipping time.
 
    Checking for Authenticity
 
    There has been rampant scamming in the DNP market lately. To ensure your DNP is authentic, set aside a sample and try to ignite it. All of it should explode. Then, drop some in water. Most of it should dissolve and the water should dye yellow. If you pass both tests, your DNP is likely legitimate.
 
      Supplements
         
   You will want to take these supplements daily while on DNP:
    - 2g Vitamin C (antioxidant)
    - 800-1200iu Vitamin E (antioxidant)
    - 1-2grams Pyruvate (may help prevent cataracts)
    - 600mg NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine) (liver support, may help prevent PN and cataracts)
     
    Optional:
    - Taurine (most effective at preventing cramping)
    - Melatonin (helps you sleep through night sweats)
    - V8 juice (250 ml, for electrolytes when you need them)
 
    For better results:
    - ECA Stack (suppresses hunger, keeps you more energized, and helps you lose a couple more pounds) - Buy Bronkaid from a pharmacy if you can't get Ephedrine.
    (25mg Ephedrine, 200mg Caffeine, 50mg Aspirin: (http://tinyurl.com/aspirinDNP, http://tinyurl.com/caffeineDNP)
    - Yohimbine HCL (appetite control and promotes fat loss) - http://tinyurl.com/YohimbineDNP
    - Keto diet (extra fat loss and supposedly reduces chance of PN) - http://tinyurl.com/KetoDietDNP
 
    You should also look into intermittent fasting
